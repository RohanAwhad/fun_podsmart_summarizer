      "Genetic algorithms (GAs) are used to solve complex computational problems by mimicking the process of natural selection. GAs are often used to search through a vast number of possibilities for solutions, taking advantage of parallelism and adaptive strategies. The rules of evolution, such as random variation and natural selection, can inspire computational search methods for adaptive computer programs. The book uses biological terminology in the context of GAs, such as chromosomes, genes, genotype, and phenotype, to describe the entities and processes involved. Hillis modified a genetic algorithm (GA) system to include coevolution of a population of networks and parasites on the same grid. The fitness of a network is determined by the parasite located at its grid location, and vice versa. The evolving population of test cases provides increasing challenges to the evolving population of networks, forcing them to keep changing and discover new sorting strategies. The GA discovers correct networks with only 61 comparisons through coevolution, a real improvement over the best networks discovered without coevolution. The number of possible bit strings of length l is 2^l, and the number of possible subsets of strings is 2^(2^l). However, there are only 3^l possible schemas. A given bit string of length l is an instance of 2^l different schemas. The Schema Theorem, introduced by John Holland, is a mathematical result that describes the growth of a schema from one generation to the next in a genetic algorithm (GA). The theorem deals only with the destructive effects of crossover and mutation, and does not account for the constructive power of crossover in recombining instances of good schemas to form better ones. The Building Block Hypothesis, proposed by Goldberg, suggests that crossover is the major source of the GA's power, and that it works by recombining instances of good schemas to form better ones. Mutation in a GA provides an \"insurance policy\" against the loss of diversity at a given bit position, and prevents every string in the population from having the same value at that position.
